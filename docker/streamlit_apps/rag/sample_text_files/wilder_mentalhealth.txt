Given the position Forest found themselves in before this game, winning was all that mattered and having secured the victory, they won't care they were distinctly second best in the first 45 minutes. Forest could have been in front less than two minutes in when Chris Wood was left unmarked but he volleyed wide from Morgan Gibbs-White's cross.

Sheffield United soon had the upper hand, though, and after he was brought down by a sliding Gonzalo Montiel in the box, Brereton Diaz got back to his feet and powered the spot-kick down the middle. Hudson-Odoi caressed a bouncing ball into the net from the corner of the penalty area 10 minutes later but given the Blades barrage that followed, it was a wonder how Forest remained level at half-time.

Brereton Diaz and Cameron Archer both spurned very presentable chances and Forest keeper Matz Sels was called into action time and again. Wood hit the bar with a header late in the half to provide a reminder of the threat posed by the visitors and soon after the break, with United players calling for a foul by Murillo as a free-kick came in, Anthony Elanga put the ball back across goal, Willy Boly nodded it down and Yates smashed it in.

Although the home side still looked dangerous on occasion, that goal appeared to settle Forest and Hudson-Odoi clipped the post with what became a practice effort for the near identical shot he fired in soon afterwards. They could have made it an even more emphatic victory in the last 25 minutes but three goals proved to be more than enough. It took some good fortune and while the job is not done yet, Forest have kept their fate in their own hands.

Four points from their last two games will make absolutely sure but, if results go their way, safety could be achieved next weekend when they host Chelsea.
