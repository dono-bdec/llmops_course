Some Burnley supporters had started to believe the great escape was on after a run of one defeat in eight games clawed their side to within two points of safety. But as the story has been time and again this season, Burnley got off to an upbeat start yet could not find the breakthrough before crumbling at the other end of the pitch.

Burnley head to Europe-chasing Tottenham next Saturday and host Forest on the final day of the season, but it is a big ask now for them to take it to the wire in the unlikeliest of survival stories. The Clarets needed to win on Saturday and the result may have been different if Larsen had been able to convert early on or official Taylor had pointed to the spot when Assignon went down in the box.

The French full-back was in the thick of the action and nearly gave his side the breakthrough, cutting on to his left foot and firing a shot at goalkeeper Dubravka. Newcastle, though, kept their composure and took their opponents apart with some incisive play which puts them in the mix for Europa League football next season.

Striker Wilson, who scored twice at Turf Moor to send Burnley down two seasons ago, may well have contributed to doing the same this time with an opportunistic effort on 19 minutes. Full-back Tino Livramento forced Muric into a full-stretch save but they did not have to wait much longer for more goals with Longstaff and Guimaraes finding space in the box before converting clinical finishes.

Burnley were woeful and provided more joy for the elated visiting supporters in the second period as Isak punished slack defending following his penalty miss to become Newcastle's fifth player to reach the 20-goal milestone in the top-flight. Newcastle embarrassed Sheffield United 8-0 earlier this season and could have run riot once more, but Guimaraes' curling shot was tipped wide by Muric while the livewire Gordon dragged off target late on.
