Lessons:

1. Building Vector Storage:
This covers how to ingest documents into Chroma. It skips over text splitting, embeddings, and pre-processing functions because those will be covered in subsequent lessons

2. Text Splitting:
This covers a few examples for text splitters and ingesting them into Chroma

3. Embeddings
Looking at how embeddings work and using a couple of embedding models

4. Slightly advanced
Indexing, multi vector retrieval, semantic embeddings

5. rag
